I contributed to the mechanical design and programming of our robot, PLUTO. This robot featured a mecanum drivetrain, angled slides, a surgical tubing intake, a pixel (scoring element) storage and deposit system with 2 degrees of motion, a hanging system, a drone (paper airplane) launcher, and an autonomous program that allowed the robot to navigate the playing field and score points without a human driver.",

To achieve this, we founded and operated the non-profit organization Scarborough STEM Alliance (SSA). Through SSA, we have reached thousands of students by hosting workshops in FIRST Lego League (FLL) and P5.JS coding at summer camps, libraries, community centers, and schools. As of 2024, we have expanded our operations beyond our community. Our initiatives include members traveling to China to host workshops and sending custom-made mini Arduino robots. We partner with outreach organizations, such as Just Cause Canada, to send these kits to Uganda. I serve as an operations executive, creating lesson plans, and as a volunteer coordinator, training volunteers. I strongly believe our initiative is impactful and life-changing, providing students with valuable experiences in STEM and robotics.",

While this website doesn't fully utilize ReactJS's capabilities, I plan to work on a future project, such as a social media or communications site, incorporating features like login/signup, live messaging, posts, and basic encryption security. I am also looking to learn how to use Google's Firebase for website hosting and integrate my database knowledge with MongoDB and Cloudinary for storing media files.`,
